//! Stela's Metal device over a Vulkan backend.
//!
//! The guest's unchanged Metal framework reaches this device through the
//! frontend; every Metal object and command lowers here to the internal
//! [`vulkan`] boundary, which the vendor's Mesa driver executes (NVK for the
//! [`nvidia`] route, RADV for the [`amd`] route once amdgpu and RADV are in
//! the image). Capabilities derive from the Vulkan device, the AIR compiler
//! and this implementation together ([`capabilities`]).
//!
//! [`library`] parses Metal libraries and exposes their original AIR and
//! metadata, which [`compiler`] lowers through the AIR compiler service. AGX machine code archives are a different input and are not
//! accepted as AIR libraries.
