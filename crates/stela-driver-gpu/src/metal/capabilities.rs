//! Metal device capabilities derived from the Vulkan device, the shader
//! compiler and this Metal implementation.
//!
//! A capability is advertised only when all three provide it: the driver
//! reports the Vulkan feature, limit or format support; the AIR compiler
//! lowers the shader constructs; and this layer implements the API path.
//! Each refusal is recorded once as a [`Gap`] naming the layer that lacks it,
//! so negative answers stay explicit. A GPU family is the conjunction of its
//! requirements. Apple1 to Apple7 are claimed, with their formats,
//! programmable blending, imageblocks and tile functions, as macOS's
//! compositor requires Apple3 of its display surfaces and every Mac that runs
//! macOS 27 has an Apple7 GPU. Metal 3 is claimed without ray tracing, which
//! `supportsRaytracing` refuses; Metal 4 and Apple8 and later, which
//! presuppose Apple's architecture, are not.
